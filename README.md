#FOMMS Workshop Topics

In computational chemistry, we spend a *lot* of time working with computers. However, very few of us have formal training in computer programming. There is little short-term incentive for us to fix this, which has led us to adopt some inefficient programming practices ([source](http://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/17781/why-do-many-talented-scientists-write-horrible-software)).

This workshop is designed around the "low-hanging fruit" of best practices - simple fixes that will result in big improvements to your productivity. The topics are admittedly boring, but doing things right will save you from having to think about them again.

######Note: this workshop is far too short to cover every best practice. For more lessons on scientific computing, check out [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/).
