# FOMMS Workshop Topics

In computational chemistry, we spend a *lot* of time working with computers. However, very few of us have formal training in computer programming. There is little short-term incentive for us to fix this, which has led us to adopt some inefficient programming practices. Some interesting reads on this include [*Nobody ever gets credit for fixing problems that never happened*](http://web.mit.edu/nelsonr/www/Repenning=Sterman_CMR_su01_.pdf), [*Why do many talented scientists write horrible software?*](http://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/17781/why-do-many-talented-scientists-write-horrible-software), and [*Why learning to code is so damn hard*](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/posts/why-learning-to-code-is-so-damn-hard).

This workshop is designed around the "low-hanging fruit" of best practices - simple fixes that will result in big improvements to your productivity. The topics are admittedly boring, but doing things right will save you from having to think about them again.

## Topics we'll cover

 * [Package managers](/package_managers/README.md)
 * [File formats](/file_formats/README.md)
 * [Version control](/version_control/README.md)
 * IPython

## Topics we won't cover

 * [Profiling and optimization](/optimization/README.md)
 * Test-driven development
 * Style guides
 * Documentation

## How to teach yourself

 * [Software Carpentry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhwElTL-mdI)
   - This organization focuses solely on teaching scientists how to code. Highly relevant!
 * Conference videos
   - Go to youtube and search. Here's a [good example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSGv2VnC0go). [Here's another](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhwElTL-mdI).
 * The popularity approach
   - Read through the [top posts on stack overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions?sort=votes). If they use terminology or tools you don't understand, take the time to learn them.
   - Similarly, read through the [most starred github repositories](https://github.com/search?q=stars:%3E1&s=stars&type=Repositories). Learn *why* each repository is popular, and understand how it may be helpful to you.
   - Github also has a [science showcase](https://github.com/showcases/science) (complete with IPython and Software Carpentry repos). The same applies - read and learn.
   - You can also read through the most downloaded packages by package manager. Here's [javascript's npm](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/star) and [python's pip](http://pypi-ranking.info/alltime).
